# Algorithm Approach for Efficient Expression Generation

## Problem Overview
The algorithm takes two inputs: a set of digits `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` and a number (e.g., `2025`), and returns an expression based on the given inputs. The key idea is to efficiently determine an expression by leveraging perfect roots and factorization.

## Approach

### 1. **Perfect Roots**
The algorithm checks if the input number is a perfect root for any integer in the set `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`. A number \( N \) is a perfect \( k \)-th root if:

\[
N = x^k \quad \text{for some} \quad x \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}, \, k \in \mathbb{N}
\]

For example, for `2025`, we compute potential roots (e.g., \( \sqrt{2025} = 45 \)) and check if the root is an integer.

**Complexity**:  
Finding roots is efficient, typically \( O(\log N) \) using algorithms like binary search or Newton's method.

### 2. **Factorization**
After finding the perfect root, the algorithm factors the result into divisors that are members of the input set. The factorization continues recursively until all factors belong to `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.

**Complexity**:  
Factorization is done via trial division up to \( \sqrt{x} \), taking \( O(\sqrt{x}) \) time, where \( x \) is the root.

### 3. **Comparison with Brute Force**
A brute force approach involves exploring all permutations of digits and operations, resulting in an exponential search space of \( O(2^n \cdot n!) \). This becomes computationally expensive as the input size increases.

### 4. **Trade-offs & Time Complexity**
- **Perfect Root Case**:  
  The algorithm runs in \( O(\log N) \) for root finding and \( O(\sqrt{x}) \) for factorization. This is much more efficient than brute force.
  
- **Non-perfect Root Case**:  
  For non-perfect roots, the number can be decomposed into "near-perfect root + residuals," and the algorithm can be generalised to find operations for the residual, still avoiding a full brute-force search.

- **Brute Force Complexity**:  
  Brute force would require checking all digit permutations and operation orders, which grows exponentially as \( O(2^n \cdot n!) \).

### 5. **Conclusion**
This approach used mathematical properties of perfect roots and factorization to reduce the problem complexity significantly. It is much more efficient than brute force, particularly for large input sets, making it a scalable and computationally feasible solution.
